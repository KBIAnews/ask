# Ask

Ask is a tool that enables editors to create embeddable calls for contributions, including text, photo, video, and audio. The contributions can be connected to existing user profiles. Editors can manage high volumes of contributions, and display the best ones in a gallery.

Ask is designed to facilitate engagement among all readers, journalists, editors, and publishers, in order to promote user-generated content that improves the quality and relevancy of journalism within communities.
